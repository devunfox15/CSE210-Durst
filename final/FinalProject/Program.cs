// Problem: Library Management System

// Description:
// A library management system is a program that helps in managing the operations and resources of a library. It allows librarians to track books, manage borrowing and returning, and handle other administrative tasks efficiently. In this scenario, I will develop a library management system using the principles of Programming with Classes.

// Solution:
// To solve the problem of managing a library effectively, I will design a library management system using C# and the principles of object-oriented programming. The system will consist of multiple classes that collaborate with each other to perform various tasks.

// Book Class:

// Responsibilities: Represents a book in the library, stores its details (title, author, ISBN, etc.).
// Abstraction: Encapsulates book-related information and provides methods to access and modify the book's details.
// Encapsulation: Private fields store book details, and public methods allow accessing and modifying them.
// Member Class:

// Responsibilities: Represents a library member, stores member details (name, address, contact information).
// Abstraction: Encapsulates member-related information and provides methods to access and modify member details.
// Encapsulation: Private fields store member details, and public methods allow accessing and modifying them.
// LibraryItem Class:

// Responsibilities: Represents a generic library item, which can be a book, DVD, etc.
// Abstraction: Provides a base class for specific library item types.
// Encapsulation: Stores common properties like title, author, etc., and provides methods for accessing them.
// Library Class:

// Responsibilities: Manages the library and its resources.
// Abstraction: Provides methods to add, remove, and search for library items.
// Encapsulation: Stores a collection of library items, manages their availability, and provides public methods for accessing and modifying them.
// BorrowingManager Class:

// Responsibilities: Handles the borrowing and returning of library items.
// Abstraction: Provides methods to manage the borrowing process, including checking availability, updating item status, etc.
// Encapsulation: Manages the borrowing and returning process internally, ensuring proper item availability and status.
// ReservationManager Class:

// Responsibilities: Handles the reservation of library items.
// Abstraction: Provides methods to manage the reservation process, including checking availability, reserving an item, etc.
// Encapsulation: Manages the reservation process internally, updating item status and availability.
// FineCalculator Class:

// Responsibilities: Calculates fines for late returns.
// Abstraction: Provides a method to calculate the fine based on the due date and the current date.
// Encapsulation: Performs calculations internally and returns the fine amount.
// UserInterface Class:

// Responsibilities: Handles user interaction and displays information.
// Abstraction: Provides methods for user input and output.
// Encapsulation: Manages user input and output within the class, interacting with other classes as necessary.
// The above classes demonstrate the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Each class has specific responsibilities and collaborates with other classes to perform various tasks in the library management system. Inheritance is used to derive specialized classes like Book and LibraryItem from a base class, and polymorphism is employed when derived classes override specific methods to provide unique behavior.

// By implementing this library management system using the principles of Programming with Classes, we can effectively manage library resources, handle borrowing and returning, and provide an efficient user interface for library staff and members.
